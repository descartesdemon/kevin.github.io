            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>I am a junior at UC Berkeley studying computer science and philosophy. I am very interested in both fields in themselves and also the intersection of the two fields in areas like philosophy of technology. I have been interested in mathematics recently as well and have been studying it on my own time.
